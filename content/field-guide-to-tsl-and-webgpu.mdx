Now supported [Twitter](https://x.com/lenysauzet) in Apple's most recent version of iOS and Safari <FootnoteRef id="1" />,
WebGPU is finally gaining widespread support, allowing for [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lenysauzet/) more advanced 3D capabilities on the web.
As someone [Test internal link](https://blog.lenysauzet.com) working with WebGL [Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet](http://example.com) on the side, this was the push I needed to, at last, dedicate some time to learning more about this new set of APIs
and see [GitHub](https://github.com/lenysauzet) how I could port over some of my existing WebGL/shader knowledge and work to it.

This work involved not only familiarizing myself with **WGSL**, the shader language designed for WebGPU, but also **TSL: Three.js's higher-level,
JavaScript-like shading language**. Moreover, WebGPU also [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/lenysauzet) introduces some new constructs, such as **compute [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@lenysauzet) shaders**, a new, exciting, yet nebulous type of shaders that seemed like
it could improve some key aspects of my workflow.

To [Discord](https://discord.com/users/lenysauzet) guide me through this learning journey, I decided the most practical way would be to spend my summer porting over key projects I've worked on throughout the years, such as my glass material, post-processing [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/lenysauzet/), particles, as well as several other fun [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/lenysauzet) shader experiments.
There were [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/lenysauzet/) numerous gotchas and undocumented [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/lenysauzet/) features, which sometimes made the experience quite frustrating, but in the end, I managed to familiarize myself with these new tools and build beautiful scenes with them.
